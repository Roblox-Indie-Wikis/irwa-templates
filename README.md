This repository provides and deploys shared templates on member wikis of the Independent Roblox Wiki Alliance.

## Adding the bot to your wiki

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your wiki must be a part of the [Indie Roblox Wiki Alliance](https://indierobloxwikis.org/) (IRWA) for it to be added to the bot. Learn more about joining [here](https://indierobloxwikis.org/joining/).

To request the addition of the bot to your wiki, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Roblox-Indie-Wikis/irwa-templates/issues) using the *Add wiki* issue form. A bureaucrat is required to approve the process before the issue will be handled.

## What the bot does

The bot will:

* Create **1** template page (Template:IRWA)
* Create **1** template css page (Template:IRWA/styles.css)
* Upload **9** wiki logos (see `templates/img` folder)

and keep these updated based on changes in the repository.

As our member wiki count grows, note that these numbers may increase with future changes regarding the alliance.
