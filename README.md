# IRWA Templates

This repo provides and deploys shared templates on member wikis of the Independent Roblox Wiki Alliance.

## Adding the bot to your wiki

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your wiki must be a part of the Indie Roblox Wiki Alliance (IRWA) for it to be added to the bot.

To request the addition of the bot to your wiki, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Roblox-Indie-Wikis/irwa-templates/issues) using the *Add wiki* issue form. A bureaucrat is required to approve the process before the issue will be handled.

## What the bot does

The bot will

* create 1 template page (Template:IRWA)
* create 1 template css page (Template:IRWA/styles.css)
* upload 7 wiki logos (see `templates/img` folder)

and keep these updated based on changes in the repo.

Note that these numbers will increase with future changes regarding the alliance.
